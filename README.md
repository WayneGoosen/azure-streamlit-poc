## Overview

I needed to create a quick proof of concept (PoC) using Streamlit but had two constraints:

- Self-host instead of using [Streamlit community cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
- Control access to the deployed website

With this in mind, containerizing and hosting on Azure was the solution. This repository provides a boilerplate to fast track this with the following implementations:

- Containerized Streamlit app with a blank `app.py` file (just add your code).
- GitHub workflow to build and publish the image to `ghcr.io`.
- Terraform code to manage infrastructure on Azure.
- GitHub workflow to execute Terraform apply & destroy infrastructure.

I hope this helps you to ship more 🚀

## What is Streamlit? 🤔

## Getting Started 🧑‍💻

> This project requires an Azure subscription to run, [Get started](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

1. Create a repository from this template repo.
2. Open a shell and run `azure login`
3. Update subject field within your respository naming in infra/scripts/credential.json
4. Execute infra/scripts/initialize.sh and capture output fields
5. Setting up environments:

	- Navigate to the your repository on GitHub.
	- Go to “Settings” > “Environments”.
	- Create a new environment 'production'

6. Adding Secrets:

	- Navigate to the your repository on GitHub.
	- Go to “Settings” > “Environments” > Select “production”.
	- Go to "Environment secrets" and select "Add environment secret"
	- Add the following secrets using the output of step 4: AZURE_ENTRA_ID_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_ENTRA_ID_TENANT_ID & AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID

## Development

> To begin, make sure you have the [Dev containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed and have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) running. Check out [Devcontainers](https://containers.dev/) for context.

1. **Clone** this repo and open it in **Visual Studio Code**.
2. You should this this notification pop up:
