## Overview

I needed to create a quick proof of concept (PoC) using Streamlit but had two constraints:

- Self-host instead of using [Streamlit community cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
- Control access to the deployed website

With this in mind, containerizing and hosting on Azure was the solution. This repository provides a boilerplate to fast track this with the following implementations:

- Containerized Streamlit app with a blank `app.py` file (just add your code).
- GitHub workflow to build and publish the image to `ghcr.io`.
- Terraform code to manage infrastructure on Azure.
- GitHub workflow to execute Terraform apply & destroy infrastructure.

I hope this helps you to ship more üöÄ

## Getting Started üßë‚Äçüíª

> This project requires an Azure subscription to run, [Get started](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

1. Create a repository from this template repo.
2. Open a shell and run `azure login`
3. Update subject field within your respository naming in infra/scripts/credential.json
4. Execute infra/scripts/initialize.sh and capture output fields
5. Setting up environments:

	- Navigate to the your repository on GitHub.
	- Go to ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù > ‚ÄúEnvironments‚Äù.
	- Create a new environment 'production'
